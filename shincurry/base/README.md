检测文件是否更改，自动重新运行

Nodemon is a utility that will monitor for any changes in your source and automatically restart your server. Perfect for development. Install it using npm.

Just use nodemon instead of node to run your code, and now your process will automatically restart when your code changes. To install, get node.js, then from your terminal run:

```
npm install -g nodemon
```
